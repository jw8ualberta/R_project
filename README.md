The iOS Face Recognition project was a school project from Fall 2020. The R Code was entirely written by myself and created on November 26, 2020. The code was again modified on January 1, 2021.

The Final Report was originally written on December 3, 2020. It was heavily modified on January 3, 2021. All plots are from the R Code.
